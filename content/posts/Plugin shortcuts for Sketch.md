### The painful movment of a mouse

The [Color Contrast Analyser for Sketch](https://github.com/getflourish/Sketch-Color-Contrast-Analyser) is a useful plugin if you'd like to make accessible digital products without leaving Sketch. But it ships without a shortcut and when you start a new design with a lot of contrast checking, it might get annoying (specially for a keyboard fanatic like me). 

---

## The solution

Luckily we can remedy the situation (somehow) easily by creating our own custom shortcut - let's see how. 

### Find the plugin

Firstly let's locate the plugin at hand. The easiest way is by opening the Sketch ***Preferences*** (`âŒ˜`+`,`) and under the ***Plugins*** tab and click the ***Reveal Plugin Folder*** in the contextual menu. Another way is to navigate using the finder, usually to be found in this path â–º Library  â–º Application Support  â–º com.bohemiancoding.sketch3 â–º Plugins

### Edit the plugin

Just to make sure where on the right page - plugins are files with the `.sketchplugin` suffix and the file name will be similar or identical to the plugin name. Sweet. Now that you've located the plugin, use the contextual menu to ***Show Package Content***. FYY - The plugin is a package, it means that and behind the scenes the plugin is a set of folders and files - some plugins holed many and some just a few. 

Once we're in the package content we'll look for a file called `manifest.js`, usually to be found in â–º Contents â–º Sketch.  When you locate it open it using a text editor - I'm using VS code but you can use TextEdit or whatever text/code editor you like.

### Edit the `manifest.js` file

Plugins might hold just one command, like this contrast-checker plugin - Some might hold dozens of commands, like the all encompassing [Automate-Sketch](https://github.com/Ashung/Automate-Sketch) plugin. 

Either way we're looking for this pattern â†’ in this example there are 2 commands with no shortcuts. We're looking for  the `name` and `shortcut` key/value pair - The name will be identical to the command as it's presented in the [Plugins select menu](https://www.notion.so/yonatankof/Plugin-shortcuts-for-Sketch-81689b34a9814b4492afb1059e96b638#11a25485adbe49caad3bdf4a011e5891), and the shortcut, well, let's edit it ðŸ’ª

```json
"commands": [
    {
      "name": "Jupiter is a gas giant",
			"identifier": "jupiter_is_a_gas_giant",
      "handler": "JupiterIsAGasGiant",
      "script": "Jupiter_Is_A_Gas_Giant.js",
      "shortcut": ""
    },
		{
      "name": "Venus is big",
      "identifier": "venus_is_big",
			"handler": "VenusIsBig",
      "script": "Venus_Is_Big.js",
      "shortcut": ""
    },
  ]
```

We can see that the example and the screenshot aren't identical, its OK, they don't have to be, every developer writes the plugin a bit differently.

I've used the `ctrl` `option` `cmd` `shift` `c` combo to get plugin running, but you can use any modifier key combination you'd like. Save the file and now the shortcut should be available in Sketch

## Good to know

### Modifier Keys

Are their name suggest, modifier keys change the normal behavior of a key - It turns `1` into a `!` - Hell yeah! These are the available modifiers - `ctrl` âŒƒ  `option` âŒ¥ `cmd` âŒ˜ `shift` â‡§ - We can use one modifier key or a combination of them. 

### Duplicated shortcuts

Using the same shortcut for more then one action is a pain we have to live with. Unfortunately there's no nice solution that addresses this issue - and [the one that was has been discontinued](https://github.com/exevil/Keys-For-Sketch). My solution is daed simple â†’ use uncommon patterns like `ctrl` `option` `cmd` and when they run out then use `ctrl` `option` `cmd` `shift`. Now clicking so many buttons might be annoying, to get around that I'm using [Karabiner Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/), it enables me to to re-map the `caps lock` as if I'm pressing all the 4 keys together. 

Here's a link to a simple guide to get this hack going by **How-To Geek** - [How to Turn Your Macâ€™s Caps Lock into an Extra Modifier Key](https://www.howtogeek.com/409904/how-to-turn-your-mac%E2%80%99s-caps-lock-into-an-extra-modifier-key/). Nice hack, thanks internet!

### Edit a shortcut

In this article we've added a short cut, bet using this process we edit existing or delete unwanted shortcuts.

Editing is dead simple, just type the desired *value*

```json
"shortcut": "**ctrl** option l"
```

```json
"shortcut": "**shift** option l"
```

---

### Remove a shortcut

Deleting a shortcut can be done by removing just the *value,* not minding the *key.*

```json
"name": "God is love",
"identifier": "god_is_love",
"script": "God_Is_Love.js",
"shortcut": ""
```

Or by removing the *key/value pair* altogether

```json
"commands": [
    {
      "name": "God is love",
			"identifier": "god_is_love",
      "script": "God_Is_Love.js"
    },
  ]
```

### No shortcut key/value pair?

Conversely, you can add a shortcut *key/value pair* if none exist, like in the case of the [Automate-Sketch](https://github.com/Ashung/Automate-Sketch) plugin.

> Mind the position of the `,` so you won't mess things up. The logic is simple - don't place a *comma* at the end of a curly bracket.

## Take aways

1. **Save time**

    Using a shortcuts might save a few second here and there instead of using the mouse or trackpad when reaching to a command in the UI. The deal is - when working  full time, all day long it might save you minutes a day and up to few hours a month.

2. **Better workflows**

    These commands are additional tools in our box, and tools we use shape the way we think.

3. **Take control** 

    Our brain is plastic and it bends in certain way - When we use our memory to trigger a command instead of lookin for it in the UI we improve our chances to form a clearer path to the command and us using it. We're bound to the way we do things
